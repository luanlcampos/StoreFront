                    <h2>Mobile Responsive</h2>
                    <p>Mobile Responsive is the dynamic change of the website structure following the screen size. The changes can be viewed on different devices. A website loaded in a desktop with a 24'' monitor can not have the same structure as one loaded in a smartphone. The user experience will be affected in one or both.  </p>
                    <p>To have a functional Mobile Responsive, Web Technologies such as Browsers, CSS, HTML and JavaScript are very crucial. If Web Technologies did not update themselves, mobile responsive would not exist in computers, laptops or mobile devices.</p>
                    <p>In my research on this topic, I gained much knowledge on how to build an efficient Mobile Responsive website. Furthermore, I noticed that Mobile Responsive is more than Media Queries. It comprises entire website structures that Web Designers develop to adapt on all types of environments.</p>
                    <p>On this website, I have used two main techniques to achieve Mobile Responsive requirements. The first of them is the use of percentages instead of other measures. When a website is built using unity of measure different than percentages, it will cause numerous errors. One of them is the horizontal scroll on devices with smaller screens. The second technique is the use of media queries to determine what kind of display the user will have access, depending on the user's device. For this website, I have used three breakpoints, the first for smartphones with a maximum width of 768px and a one-column layout. The second was set for tablets with a maximum width of 1024px containing a two-column layout. The last one was set for laptops, small screens, and tablets on landscape mode with a maximum width of 1365px and a three-column layout. However, with fewer elements per line on product grade than the three-column display of devices with larger screens.</p>
