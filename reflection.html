                    <h2>Mobile Responsive</h2>
                    <p>With the advance of technologies, and consequently, the increase of usage of mobile devices for accessing web pages, web developers and designers had to think about an alternative solution that will accomplish the new device's display. The solution was based on a device's screen size, and it is called Mobile Responsive.</p>
                    <p>Mobile Responsive is the dynamic change of the website structure depending on the screen size. The changes could be noticed in different devices. For example, a website loaded in desktop with a 24'' monitor could not have the same structure as if it was loaded in a smartphone. The user experience will be affected in one or both of them.  </p>
                    <p>To be possible to have a functional Mobile Responsive, Web Technologies are very crucial. If Web Technologies did not update themselves, so there would not have a way to build useful websites on all computers, laptops or mobile devices. In other words, without the updates of browsers, CSS rules, HTML and JavaScript, the client would not have the multiple designs available to use.</p>
                    <p>Researching on this topic, I could acquire much knowledge on how to build an efficient Mobile Responsive website. Furthermore, I could also notice that the Mobile Responsive is not just about Media Queries. However, it is about the entire website structure that Web Designers build to adapt to all types of environments.</p>
                    <p>On this website, I have used <b>two main techniques</b>  to achieve Mobile Responsive requirements. <b>The first technique</b> is the use of percentages instead of pixels or any other measures. When a website is built using unity of measure different than percentages, it will cause numerous errors. For example, if you built a website with a width determined in pixels and suppose that client has a screen smaller than the width of your website. It will result in a horizontal scroll, which makes the user experience worse and more laborious. </p>
                    <p><b>The second technique</b> is the use of media queries to determine what kind of display the user will have access, depending on the user's device. Various tables indicate the width of many devices such as the iPhone, the iPad, old Laptops, along with others. Therefore, for this website, I have used three breakpoints, the first for smartphones with a maximum width of 768px and a one-column layout. The second was set for tablets with a maximum width of 1024px containing a two-column layout. Moreover, the last one was set for laptops, small screens, and tablets on landscape mode with a maximum width of 1365px and a three-column layout but with fewer elements per line on product grade than the three-column display of devices with larger screens.</p>
